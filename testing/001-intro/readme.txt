-Vitest is basically perfectly compatible with Jest.
-Vitest uses native ES6 modules by default (Jest can use ES6 modules, but the setup is much more complicated)
-Vitest works easily with TypeScript and JSX (Jest is overly complicated to use this way)
-Vitest is both a test runner and an assertion library.
